## ðŸ“Œ What is Linear Regression?

**Linear Regression** is one of the simplest and most commonly used machine learning algorithms. It is used to find the relationship between two variables â€” one input (called the independent variable) and one output (called the dependent variable). For example, in this project, we used the size of a pizza as the input and its price as the output. Linear regression tries to draw the best straight line that fits the data points. This line helps us predict the price of a pizza based on its size. The model learns the pattern from the data and uses a simple formula like Price = m Ã— Size + c, where m is the slope and c is the intercept. Once trained, the model can accurately predict prices for new pizza sizes.
